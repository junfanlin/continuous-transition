Welcome to Tianshou!
====================

**Tianshou** (`天授 <https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%A4%A9%E6%8E%88>`_) is a reinforcement learning platform based on pure PyTorch. Unlike existing reinforcement learning libraries, which are mainly based on TensorFlow, have many nested classes, unfriendly API, or slow-speed, Tianshou provides a fast-speed framework and pythonic API for building the deep reinforcement learning agent. The supported interface algorithms include:

* :class:`~tianshou.policy.PGPolicy` `Policy Gradient <https://papers.nips.cc/paper/1713-policy-gradient-methods-for-reinforcement-learning-with-function-approximation.pdf>`_

* :class:`~tianshou.policy.ImitationPolicy` Imitation Learning
* :class:`~tianshou.data.PrioritizedReplayBuffer` `Prioritized Experience Replay <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.05952.pdf>`_
* :meth:`~tianshou.policy.BasePolicy.compute_episodic_return` `Generalized Advantage Estimator <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02438.pdf>`_

Here is Tianshou's other features:

* Elegant framework, using only ~2000 lines of code
* Support parallel environment sampling for all algorithms: :ref:`parallel_sampling`
* Support recurrent state representation in actor network and critic network (RNN-style training for POMDP): :ref:`rnn_training`
* Support any type of environment state (e.g. a dict, a self-defined class, ...): :ref:`self_defined_env`
* Support customized training process: :ref:`customize_training`
* Support n-step returns estimation :meth:`~tianshou.policy.BasePolicy.compute_nstep_return` for all Q-learning based algorithms
* Support multi-agent RL: :doc:`/tutorials/tictactoe`

If you use Anaconda or Miniconda, you can install Tianshou through the following command lines:

.. code-block:: bash

    # create a new virtualenv and install pip, change the env name if you like
    $ conda create -n myenv pip
    # activate the environment
    $ conda activate myenv
    # install tianshou
    $ pip install tianshou

After installation, open your python console and type
::

    import tianshou as ts
    print(ts.__version__)

If no error occurs, you have successfully installed Tianshou.
