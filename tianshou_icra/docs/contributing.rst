Documentation
-------------

Documentations are written under the ``docs/`` directory as ReStructuredText (``.rst``) files. ``index.rst`` is the main page. A Tutorial on ReStructuredText can be found `here <https://pythonhosted.org/an_example_pypi_project/sphinx.html>`_.

API References are automatically generated by `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/>`_ according to the outlines under ``docs/api/`` and should be modified when any code changes.

To compile documentation into webpages, run

.. code-block:: bash

    $ make html

under the ``docs/`` directory. The generated webpages are in ``docs/_build`` and can be viewed with browsers.

Chinese documentation is in https://tianshou.readthedocs.io/zh/latest/, and the develop version of documentation is in https://tianshou.readthedocs.io/en/dev/.

Pull Request
------------

All of the commits should merge through the pull request to the ``dev`` branch. The pull request must have 2 approvals before merging.
